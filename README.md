# Submitting a bug
Use the "Issues" tab at the top of the screen.
When filling out an issue report, please include the following:
1) General description of when the issue happened
2) How to reproduce the issue
3) At least the `log_error.txt` file found in the Midinous user directory
   * Windows: `%LocalAppData%/Midinous`
   * Mac: `%user%/.local/share/Midinous/log`
4) Screenshots aren't required but could be helpful

Generally, when Midinous crashes, the program will simply close, but there are other issues that appear that won't keep the program from running.

Thank you for reporting issues! You're helping to make this program better.
