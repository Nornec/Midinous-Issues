# Submitting a bug
Use the "Issues" tab at the top of the screen.
When filling out an issue report, please include the following:
1) General description of when the issue happened
2) How to reproduce the issue
3) At least the `log_error.txt` file found in the Midinous user directory
   * Windows: `%LocalAppData%/Midinous`
   * Mac: `%user%/.local/share/Midinous/log`
4) Screenshots aren't required but could be helpful

Generally, when Midinous crashes, the program will simply close, but there are other issues that appear that won't keep the program from running.
